- 👋 Hi, I’m Sergey Tsvetkov, IT Professional with a passion for producing quite an impact with my work.
- 👀 I have more than 10 years of experience under my belt - the one that leaves burning buildings and a sense of satisfaction for my customers.
- 🌱 I come with best of both worlds of Java Enterprise and Big Data - as Harvey Dent, you tell me which side is the worst. I could do a project if it involves Java, Spring, Hibernate and that whole story with possibly Kotlin and Python involved. But on the other hand - I could help you build a Data Warehouse and connect data streams with ETL to it using Hadoop with Spark stack and Scala programming language.
- 💞️ I also am proficient in clouds - check out my Azure and AWS certificates below.
- 📫 If your business or your team or your project is in serious need of creating some quality systems or products, get in touch now! 

Feel free to reach me.
